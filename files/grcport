#!/bin/bash

# This script forwards some remote port on the server to the same port on your local machine.
# This means you can access ports that aren't open to the internet.

# Credit where credit is due, the idea for this came to me from Engineer Man on Youtube:
# https://youtu.be/Zuwa8zlfXSY

# USAGE:
# - grcport 1234
#   forwards port 1234 on the server to 127.0.0.1:1234

if [[ -z "${GRC_PORT}" ]]; then
    echo "GRC_PORT not set - please check your .bash_secrets."
    exit 1
fi

if [[ -z "${1}" ]]; then
    echo "Please specify a port."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Running connection from ${GRC_HOSTNAME}:$1 to 127.0.0.1:$1"

# This is the magic line
ssh -L $1:127.0.0.1:$1 $USER@$GRC_HOSTNAME -N -p $GRC_PORT

exit 0
